Dr. Smith\u2019s interests mainly focus on the manifestations of anti-racism in contemporary America. Generally, Smith believes many current anti-racism initiatives operate from a place of minority disempowerment. Hence, Smith argues for a more empowering form of anti-racism. His op-eds on this particular subject can be found in\u00a0*Newsweek, Areo Magazine, Penn Live, Heterodox: The Blog*\u00a0and\u00a0*The York Daily Record*. Also, Smith moderates the Rhetoric and Composition subgroup of the Heterodox Academy, an organization that promotes \u201copen inquiry, viewpoint diversity, and constructive disagreement.\u201d Along with books, Smith has been published in several academic journals and has had op-eds on other topics published in\u00a0*USA Today*,\u00a0*RealClearPolitics*, and\u00a0*The Washington Examiner*.
